		<h1>Cities I have lived in</h1>

			<p>I grew up in Roslyn and I went to school in upstate New York where Binghamton is located. I now live in Colorado and I am attending Galvanize school.</p>

		<li>Denver, Colorado</li>

	<h1>Cities I want to visit</h1>
		<p>I want to visit Tokyo because I always wanted to visit Japan. It seems like an awesome place to see. Sydney seems like a great place to do extreme sports, see wild animals and the people seem really fun. Boston so I can boo at the Boston fans. Portland I hear has great food. I hear Seattle is an awesome city. Vancouver to ski and the people seem fun.</p>
